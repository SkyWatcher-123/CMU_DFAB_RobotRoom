3. ABB IRB 4400_45_196 (stand-alone)
  2.1. abb_irb4400_45_support (Please do not use the original abb_irb4400_support package from ros_industrial!!! That package has an ABB IRB4400L/30, which is a different robot configuration. Using the wrong package can cause lethal damage!!!)
	2.2. abb_irb4400_45_196_config
4. ABB IRB6640 with Track 6004 (stand-alone)
	3.1. abb_irb6640_support (note that this package is also different from the original package by ros_industrial, it includes a 6004 track)
	3.2. abb_irb6640_moveit_config
5. ABB IRB6640 with Track 6004 + ABB IRB 4400_45_196 (separate and combined move_group)
	4.1.  abb_irb6640_irb4400_support
	4.2.  dfab_irb6640_irb4400_moveit_config (with DFAB.scene)

6. DFAB_robots: a user wrapper package allowing end-effector customization, scene loadings, etc.

Important Notes: ABB IRB4400/45 in DFAB has a IRC5 Controller with RobotWare 5.15.06, therefore it only supports abb_driver (trajectory instruction), not abb_driver (which includes RWS I/O controls and EGM)
